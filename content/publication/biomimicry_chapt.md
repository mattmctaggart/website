abstract = "Nanostructured soft materials combine structure and function to produce effects inspired by natural systems. Recent innovations in polymer science and supramolecular chemistry have led to the development of materials that can respond to and control their microenvironment, allowing them to increase the efficiency of chemical processes while decreasing their ecological impact. Size effects are profound at the nanoscale, allowing for a broad range of applications. This chapter features synthetic biomimetic nanosystems at different size regimes and match them with biological counterparts from tissues through cell walls to vesicles and proteins. The application of soft, bioinspired nanomaterials in fields ranging from medicine to sustainable energy represents a fundamental advancement in science
and technology"
